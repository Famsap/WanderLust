# 🌐 Airbnb Replica (WanderLust)

A comprehensive replica of the Airbnb platform, built from the ground up to solidify core concepts in full-stack MERN-stack adjacent development. This project was primarily developed while following the **Apna College Web Development Bootcamp**.

### Key Learning Outcomes

1.  **MVC Architecture:** Structuring the application with clear separation between Models, Views, and Controllers/Routes.
2.  **Authentication & Authorization:** Mastering user security using **Passport.js** for session management and implementing custom authorization middleware.
3.  **Error Handling:** Implementing robust asynchronous error handling using `wrapAsync` and custom `ExpressError` classes.
4.  **Database Modeling:** Designing relationships (one-to-many) between Listings, Users, and Reviews in MongoDB.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [Your Repository URL]`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Set up MongoDB connection string in your `.env` file (or directly in `app.js`).
4.  Start the server: `npm start` (or `nodemon app.js`)
